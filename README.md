# Sapper TailwindCSS Starter

Sapper, Svelte, TailwindCSS, PostCSS starter template.

## Getting started

### Using `degit`

To create a new Sapper project based on Rollup locally, run

```bash
npx degit zdproduction/sapper-tailwindcss my-app
```

[`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) is a scaffolding tool that lets you create a directory from a branch in a repository.

Replace `my-app` with the path where you wish to create the project.

### Running the project

Once you have created the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.
